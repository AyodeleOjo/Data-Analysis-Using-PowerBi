# Data-Analysis-Using-PowerBi
My submission  for DSN AI Bootcamp Qualification 2023: Power BI Track Hackathon! This hackathon aims to showcase participants' data visualization and reporting skills using the NESG Household Survey 2018 dataset.

# Introduction 
This project was to explore valuable insights into Nigerians household’s living 
conditions and contribute to informed decision making for the country’s development. 

The NESG Household Survey 2018 provides a comprehensive dataset on household living conditions in Nigeria. This data is crucial for shaping policies and monitoring Nigeria’s progress. 

Thus, this dataset was used to create visualizations and reports highlighting key findings and analytical insights.

# Method and Insights 
The below were the four key areas that I engaged in during the data analysis process. 

* Data Preparation

Deficient or incorrect data can have a major impact that results in invalid reports, a loss of trust, and a negative effect on business decisions, which can lead to loss in revenue, a negative business impact, and more. Before a report can be created, data must be prepared. Data preparation is the process of profiling, cleaning, and transforming your data to get it ready to modeland visualize.

Data preparation is the process of taking raw data and turning it into information that is trusted and understandable. It involves, among other things, ensuring the integrity of the data, correcting wrong or inaccurate data, identifying missing data, converting data from one structure to another or from one type to another, or even a task as simple as making data more readable. 

* Data Modeling
  
When the data is in a proper state, it's ready to be modeled. Data modeling is the process of determining how your tables are related to each other. This process is done by defining and creating relationships between the tables. From that point, you can enhance the model by defining metrics and adding custom calculations to enrich your data.

The model is another critical component that has a direct effect on the performance of your report and overall data analysis. A poorly designed model can have a drastically negative impact on the general accuracy and performance of your report. Conversely, a well-designed model with well-prepared data will ensure a properly efficient and trusted report. This notion is more prevalent when you are working with data at scale. 

* Data Visualization
  
By using appropriate visualizations and interactions in Power Bi, I provided an effective report that guides the reader through the content quickly and efficiently, 
therefore allowing the reader to follow a narrative into the data

* Analyze 

The analyze task is the important step of understanding and interpreting the information that is displayed on the report.

Here are the main findings and insights from the report...See the Executive Report
